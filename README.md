# Extract-text
This repo will help you to collect text from different file format namely Image (if it contains any!), PDF, Word Document. To get the text from the file you just have to mention the <b>file path</b>. 

# Requirments
PyPDF2 (for extracting text from a PDF)
docx (for extracting text from a word document)
openCV (cv2) and pytesseract (for extracting text from images)

I will also encourage you to read about the required python packages mainly openCV and pytesseract as they have much more application than just extracting text from images

# Note
The variable fileName is actually the file path, but if the file is in same directory in which you are working just input the file name it will work fine.
